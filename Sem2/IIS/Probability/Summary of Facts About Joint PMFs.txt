Summary of Facts About Joint PMFs:

Let X and Y be random variables associated with the same experiment.
• The joint PMF of X and Y is defined by
pX,Y (x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y).
• The marginal PMFs of X and Y can be obtained from the joint PMF,
using the formulas
pX(x) = summation(over y)pX,Y (x, y), pY (y) = summation(over x)pX,Y (x, y).
x & y are independent random variables if::
P(X=x,Y=y)=P(X=x).P(Y=y)
• A function g(X, Y ) of X and Y defines another random variable, and
E g(X, Y ) = 
x,y
g(x, y)pX,Y (x, y).
If g is linear, of the form aX + bY + c, we have
E[aX + bY + c] = aE[X] + bE[Y ] + c.
